### Hello, world. Gozman here.

I build software I’d love to use. Software that’s fast, beautiful, and impactful.

Most of the software I build is with TypeScript and its ecosystem of frameworks and tools. That’s where I feel most at home. I’m also interested in Go and Rust for their performance, reliability, and different approaches to software development.

#### Get in touch
I'm always open to discussing new projects, ideas, or opportunities. Let's build something amazing together!
